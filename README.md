# Tooso Search for Magento

[Tooso](http://tooso.ai) is a cloud-based, multi-language search tool for e-commerce.

This extension replaces the default search of Magento with a typo-tolerant, fast & relevant search experience backed by [Tooso](http://tooso.ai/Default.aspx).

## Description

This extension replaces the default Magento search engine with one based on Tooso API.
It provide the following features:

* Fulltext search for catalog products (currently advanced search is not supported)
* Scheduled indexing of catalog products
* Automatic typo correction
* Search keywords suggest

## Requirements

The only requirement for the module is the default Magento cronjob execution correctly configured.
Something like the following is a good configuration:

```
*/5 * * * * php -f /absolute/path/to/magento/cron.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
```

This will run the Magento jobs schedule and executions every 5 minutes. *Note:* the Tooso indexing flow start every 15 minutes.

Here is some additional info on how to add cron jobs with Cpanel and Plesk, which are some of the most popular web panels:

* [CPanel - Add a cron job](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/ALD/Cron+Jobs#CronJobs-Addacronjob)
* [Plesk - How do I set up cron jobs](https://www.interspire.com/support/kb/questions/382/How+do+I+set+up+CRON+on+my+server+using+Plesk%3F)

If you can't access your server configuration, please ask your hosting provider to configure crontab for you.

## External Dependencies

[Mobile Detect](http://mobiledetect.net/)

It is placed under `lib/Bitbull/Mobile` directory, the main class file is renamed from *Mobile_Detect* to *Detect.php* 
and class name is renamed to *Bitbull_Mobile_Detect*. 
This prevent compatibility issues by other modules. 
Mobile Detect class is globally reachable as `Bitbull_Mobile_Detect`. 

## Installation Instructions

You can install the extension with following methods:

### Copying files manually

Copy all files and directories recursively from `src` directory into your document root.

### Using Composer

If you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) for manage your module dependencies, you can install the module adding this repository to your `composer.json` file:

```
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/bitbull-team/Bitbull_Tooso"
        }
    ]
}
```

Then you can add the module dependency:

```
{
    "require": {
        "magento-hackathon/magento-composer-installer": "*",
        "bitbull/magento-tooso-search": "1.0.*"
    }
}
```

Finally, you can launch the command `composer update` inside your project root directory.

Regardless the method you choose, after installation you need to clear the cache and logout from the admin panel and then login again.

## Customize reindex flow

By default, the catalog reindex process start every 15 minutes. This is done through the standard Magento cron framework (more info [here](http://www.webguys.de/magento-1/tuerchen-08-magento-cron-demystified)).
You can customize the frequency of reindex schedule editing the file `app/code/community/Bitbull/Tooso/etc/config.xml`:

```
    <crontab>
        <jobs>
            <tooso_reindex>
                <schedule>
                    <cron_expr>*/15 * * * *</cron_expr>
                </schedule>
                <run>
                    <model>tooso/observer::rebuildIndex</model>
                </run>
            </tooso_reindex>
        </jobs>
    </crontab>
```

you can change the value of node `<cron_expr>` using any standard [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression).

## Tips & Tricks

If you are using a proxy in front of Magento, like a load balancer, an HA proxy or a Varnish instance add this configuration to Magento `local.xml` file:
```xml
<global>
    <remote_addr_headers>
        <header1><![CDATA[HTTP_X_REAL_IP]]></header1>
        <header2><![CDATA[HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR]]></header2>
    </remote_addr_headers>
</global>
```
this in order to identify the correct user's IP using `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-IP` HTTP headers.
